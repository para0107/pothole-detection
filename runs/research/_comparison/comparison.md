# RDDS detector — experiment comparison

Metric: **mAP50-95** on the **test** split.

Measured seed-noise floor: **0.0056**. Any difference smaller than this is not a result.

## Method

Across-seed spread is reported as the standard deviation plus a 10,000-sample percentile bootstrap CI for the mean (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993). Two experiments are compared by a two-sided paired permutation test over per-class AP@50, generating the null by random sign flips of the paired differences (Ernst, 2004) — no normality assumption, which matters at 10 classes.

Limitation: the stronger test would bootstrap over test images rather than classes. That needs per-image predictions, which are not among the artefacts these runs currently emit.
